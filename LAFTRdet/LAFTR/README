Simple Geant4 simmulation for a 6 Mev plane wave of gamma rays
directed at a 50mm by 30cm of plastic polyvinly_tulene scintillator place
in air.

The the simulation runs records the energy deposited by every individual 
gamma ray into a txt file called events.txt located in the build file. A histogram is generated in the via python using the matplotlib.pyplots library. 

To run the simulation must be compiled with cmake 
===========================================
Following good cmake practive
the build for the project must be built in a serprate build directory 

mkdir LAFTR-build
cd LAFTR-build

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/geant4install /path/to/LAFTR
